# modbus-arduino-1
First library needed for using arduino as a modbus slave through usb

This library provides the `Modbus.cpp` and `Modbus.h` files, needed to run a modbus slave(server) on an arduino with USB serial capabilities. A second library, which provides `ModbusSerial.ccp` and `ModbusSeria.h` is needed.
This are forked from [here](https://github.com/andresarmento/modbus-arduino), but are in a separate repo so that I can pull them as dependencies in Platformio.
